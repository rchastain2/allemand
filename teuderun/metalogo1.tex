%The package to use is metalogo (which xltxtra loads and uses for the logo).
%
%Don't load xltxtra which does also other things, mostly unwanted.
%
%Besides, metalogo can be used with any engine.
%
%You can also employ hologo, but metalogo provides functions that help to adapt the (La)TeX related logos to different fonts.
%
%Consult the documentation of both packages for more details. In the example, I use both, but metalogo is normally to be preferred.
